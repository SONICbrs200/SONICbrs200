- I have a dream, I want to become the SEGA Sonic Team's CEO.
- That dream is mine, and I won't leave it. I'll come this a truth.

- Explaining better the account's objetive: for while, I do not have plans to post anything that could aggregate to the GitHub's Community. This is just a account to save my university projects and do have a GitHub's account.
 At the moment, I'm searching for a first experience job. To reach my dream is important the first step, and if you'd support this one I'll be so thankful.
